# Incident Report: DNS Protocol Error (Port 53 Unreachable)

This folder contains a cybersecurity incident analysis completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** on Coursera.

## 🧠 Scenario

Customers were unable to access the website `yummyrecipesforme.com` and encountered a “destination port unreachable” error. Using `tcpdump`, I investigated the issue and found ICMP packets indicating a DNS query failure on UDP port 53.

## 📄 Files

- `incident-report.pdf`: My written incident report in response to the log analysis.
- `tcpdump-log.txt`: Simulated output from the `tcpdump` network analyzer.
- `screenshot.png`: Screenshot of the error during the incident simulation.

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated

- Packet log analysis using tcpdump
- Identifying affected network protocols
- Writing a professional cybersecurity incident report
- Proposing remediation actions (e.g., DNS service configuration)
