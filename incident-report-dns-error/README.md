# Incident Report: DNS Redirection & Malware Injection

This folder contains the incident analysis of a real-world simulation from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate training.

- **Scenario**: DNS poisoning and brute-force admin panel access.
- **Tools used**: tcpdump, static code analysis.
- **Protocols involved**: DNS, HTTP, TCP.
- **Skills demonstrated**: Network traffic analysis, incident documentation, remediation proposal.

## Files
- `incident_log.txt`: Captured network traffic showing the DNS request and HTTP redirection.
- `incident_report.md`: Full report with root cause analysis and remediation.

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated

- Packet log analysis using tcpdump
- Identifying affected network protocols
- Writing a professional cybersecurity incident report
- Proposing remediation actions (e.g., DNS service configuration)
