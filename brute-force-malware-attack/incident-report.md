**Security Incident Report - yummyrecipesforme.com**

---

**1. Network Protocol(s) Involved**

During the investigation with the `tcpdump` packet analysis tool, the following network protocols were identified:

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Used to resolve the domain names yummyrecipesforme.com and greatrecipesforme.com into IP addresses.

- **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**: Used to send and receive content between the user’s browser and both the legitimate and malicious websites.

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Transport protocol used by HTTP to ensure reliable and ordered data delivery.

**2. Incident Documentation**

**Summary:**

The incident occurred on yummyrecipesforme.com, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. Customers reported suspicious behavior, such as being prompted to download unknown files and being redirected to another domain (greatrecipesforme.com).

**Cause of the Incident:**

A former employee performed a brute force attack on the site’s admin panel, using default passwords until the correct one was found. After gaining access, the attacker altered the website’s source code to embed a malicious JavaScript function. This function prompted users to download and execute a file. Upon execution, the script redirected the browser to the malicious website.

**Technical Analysis:**

1. The client browser initiates a DNS request to resolve yummyrecipesforme.com.
2. DNS responds with the IP address (203.0.113.22).
3. The browser establishes a TCP/HTTP connection with the server.
4. The server delivers HTML content containing malicious JavaScript.
5. The script triggers a file download and the user executes it.
6. The browser makes another DNS request for greatrecipesforme.com.
7. DNS responds with IP 192.0.2.17.
8. A new HTTP connection is established with the malicious server.

This sequence shows a complete compromise of the web application.

**Observed Impacts:**

- Potential user data leakage.
- Loss of customer trust.
- Damage to the company's brand and reputation.
- Possible malware infections on user devices.

**Sources of Evidence:**

- Packet logs captured via tcpdump.
- User complaints submitted through helpdesk.
- Senior analyst’s review of the website source code.

**3. Recommendation to Prevent Brute Force Attacks**

**Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

**Justification:** Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to present a second form of verification (e.g., SMS code, authenticator app, hardware key) in addition to the password. Even if a malicious actor manages to guess or obtain a password, they will not be able to log in without the second factor. This effectively prevents brute force attacks against administrative accounts.

**Additional Suggested Measures:**

- Enforce login attempt limits (lockout mechanism).
- Require strong, complex passwords.
- Monitor authentication logs for suspicious activity.
- Regularly audit and rotate admin credentials.

**Conclusion:**

This incident highlights the critical need for secure web development and system administration practices. Weak passwords, a lack of login monitoring, and absence of multi-factor authentication directly contributed to the success of the attack.
